## Overview

This script automates the post-installation setup of a Fedora Workstation. It includes tasks such as updating firmware, configuring DNF for faster downloads, installing RPM Fusion, managing packages, configuring GNOME settings, and much more. The goal is to streamline the setup process after a fresh installation of Fedora Workstation.
